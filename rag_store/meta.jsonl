Should such improvement processes be unsuccessful in improving an employee’s performance, Antraweb Technologies may decide to end an employee’s employment. Depending on the circumstances, performance improvement action may include verbal or written warnings, counselling or retraining. Antraweb Technologies requires a minimum standard of conduct and performance which will be made clear to employees in management appraisals. If an employee does not meet this standard, Antraweb Technologies will take appropriate corrective action, such as training. Formal performance improvement procedures will generally only start when other corrective action fails. If an employee deliberately breaches business policy or procedure, or engages in misconduct, Antraweb Technologies may start improvement procedures, or, in cases of serious misconduct or breach of policy, may dismiss an employee. Each employee must understand their responsibilities, be counselled and given the opportunity to reach the standards expected of them.

Antraweb Technologies will advise the employee of any shortfall in their performance, and give them an opportunity to respond. 2.

Conflict of Interest Policy Conflict of interest arises whenever the personal, professional or business interests of an employee are potentially at odds with the best interests of Antraweb Technologies. All employees are required to act in good faith towards Antraweb Technologies. Employees need to be aware of the potential for a conflict of interest to arise and should always act in the best interests of Antraweb Technologies. As individuals, employees may have private interests that from time to time conflict, or appear to conflict, with their employment with Antraweb Technologies. Employees should aim to avoid being put in a situation where there may be a conflict between the interests of Antraweb Technologies and their own personal or professional interests, or those of relatives or friends. Where such a conflict occurs (or is perceived to occur), the interests of Antraweb Technologies will be balanced against the interests of the staff member and, unless exceptional circumstances exist, resolved in favour of Antraweb Technologies. It is impossible to define all potential areas of conflict of interest. If an employee is in doubt if a conflict exists, they should raise the matter with their manager.

All employees are required to act in good faith towards Antraweb Technologies. Employees need to be aware of the potential for a conflict of interest to arise and should always act in the best interests of Antraweb Technologies. As individuals, employees may have private interests that from time to time conflict, or appear to conflict, with their employment with Antraweb Technologies. Employees should aim to avoid being put in a situation where there may be a conflict between the interests of Antraweb Technologies and their own personal or professional interests, or those of relatives or friends. Where such a conflict occurs (or is perceived to occur), the interests of Antraweb Technologies will be balanced against the interests of the staff member and, unless exceptional circumstances exist, resolved in favour of Antraweb Technologies. It is impossible to define all potential areas of conflict of interest. If an employee is in doubt if a conflict exists, they should raise the matter with their manager.

All employees are required to act in good faith towards Antraweb Technologies. Employees need to be aware of the potential for a conflict of interest to arise and should always act in the best interests of Antraweb Technologies. As individuals, employees may have private interests that from time to time conflict, or appear to conflict, with their employment with Antraweb Technologies. Employees should aim to avoid being put in a situation where there may be a conflict between the interests of Antraweb Technologies and their own personal or professional interests, or those of relatives or friends. Where such a conflict occurs (or is perceived to occur), the interests of Antraweb Technologies will be balanced against the interests of the staff member and, unless exceptional circumstances exist, resolved in favour of Antraweb Technologies. It is impossible to define all potential areas of conflict of interest. If an employee is in doubt if a conflict exists, they should raise the matter with their manager.

If the medical certificate indicates the employee is not fit for work, she may be required to start Maternity leave or take a period of unpaid leave as soon as practicable. Return to work If the employee has agreed to contact during leave, then towards the end of the leave period, the manager should confirm the employee’s intention to return on the agreed date.

Should such improvement processes be unsuccessful in improving an employee’s performance, Antraweb Technologies may decide to end an employee’s employment.

Antraweb Technologies requires a minimum standard of conduct and performance which will be made clear to employees in management appraisals. If an employee does not meet this standard, Antraweb Technologies will take appropriate corrective action, such as training. Formal performance improvement procedures will generally only start when other corrective action fails. If an employee deliberately breaches business policy or procedure, or engages in misconduct, Antraweb Technologies may start improvement procedures, or, in cases of serious misconduct or breach of policy, may dismiss an employee. Each employee must understand their responsibilities, be counselled and given the opportunity to reach the standards expected of them.
